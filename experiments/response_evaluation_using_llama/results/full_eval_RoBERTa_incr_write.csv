They make frozen meals, deli meats, pasta sauce, breads, soups and ice creams, this sort of thing.....
Person2: Yeah?
Person1: ....I'm sorry....I lost my thoughts, what I was saying....
Person2: You were talking about the promotion --
Person1: -- the promotion says: buy any 10 Healthy Choice products and get 500 miles of airline travel or 1,000 for purchases made with a special coupon. So in the supermarket, you notice their products, first you notice they have a Teriyaki Chicken Dinner at $1.79 - that's a pretty good deal....but then I noticed they had soup at 89 cents a can.....and you start to do the math and you start to notice that it's a really amazing deal because I stumbled across the pudding at 25 cents a cup. Now the crucial thing is the bar codes on the label. That's those little bar codes, you know? The universal product codes?
Person2: Yeah.
Person1: That's what's used to redeem the mileage, so in noticing the pudding, each cup had an individual bar code -- in other words, two dollars and fifty cents for ten cups of pudding is 500 miles. Add in the coupon: it's one thousand. You see?
Person2: Yeah.
Person1: You see?
Person2: Yeah, no, I see --
Person1: You see if you spent $3,000 dollars on pudding you could earn over one million frequent flyer miles.
