Person1: I don't think so. Just period, I think. She told him... God gave them the ugliest creation he could think of. Karl has an entire book -- a notebook. On every page it says "Franklin Chapter 1 Verse number 1." He wrote that a few years ago after he'd learned to write. His father's name was Franklin.
Person2: That's really strange. What does it mean?
Person1: One of his Daddy's Bible lessons I imagine. Y'all pull up a chair. I'll go out and talk to him.

Person2: How could I?  Dave, as you know, President Kennedy was assassinated on Friday.  A man named Lee Harvey Oswald was arrested as a suspect and then was murdered yesterday by a man named Jack Ruby.  We've heard reports that Oswald spent the summer in New Orleans and we've been advised you knew Oswald pretty well.
Person1: That's not true.  I never met anybody named Oswald.  Anybody who told you that has to be crazy.
Person2: But you are aware, he served in your Civil Air Patrol unit when he was a teenager.
Person1: No... if he did, I don't remember him.  There were lots of kids in and out... y'know.
Person2: I'm sure you've seen this.  Perhaps you knew this man under another name?
Person1: No, I never saw him before in my life.
Person2: Well that must've been mistaken information we got.  Thanks for straightening it out for us.  There is one other matter that's come up, Dave.  We were told you took a trip to Texas shortly after the assassination of Friday.
Person1: Yeah, now that's true.  I drove to Houston.
Person2: What was so appealing about Houston?
Person1: I hadn't been there ice skating in many years, and I had a couple of young friends with me, and we decided we wanted to go ice skating.
Person2: Dave, may I ask why the urge to go ice skating in Texas happened to strike you during one of the most violent thunderstorms in recent memory?
Person1: Oh, it was just a spur of the moment thing...  the storm wasn't that bad.
Person2: I see.  And where did you drive?
Person1: We went straight to Houston, and then Saturday night we drove to Galveston and stayed over there.
Person2: Why Galveston?
Person1: No particular reason.  Just to go somewhere.
Person2: And then Sunday?
Person1: In the morning we went goose hunting. Then headed home, but I dropped the boys off to see some relatives and I stayed in Hammond.
Person2: Did you bag any geese on this trip?
Person1: I believe the boys got a couple.
Person2: But the boys told us they didn't get any.
Person1: Oh yes, well, come to think of it, they're right.  We got to where the geese were and there were thousands of them.  But you couldn't approach them.  They were a wise bunch of birds.
Person2: Your young friends also told us you had no weapons in the car.  Dave, isn't it a bit difficult to hunt for geese without a shotgun?
Person1: Yes, now I remember, Mr. Garrison. I'm sorry, I got confused.  We got out there near the geese and it was only then we realized we'd forgotten our shotguns.  Stupid, right?  So of course we didn't get any geese.
Person2: I see.  Dave thank you for your time.  I'm sorry it has to end inconveniently for you, but I'm going to have you detained for further questioning by the FBI.
Person1: Why?  What's wrong?
Person2: Dave, I find your story simply not believable.

Person1: So what should I do?  Call the police? You think they'll believe me?
Person2: They will if they catch him in the act. You can make that happen, Dad.  You can tail the victim and call it in at just the right moment.

Person2: I do know.  I'm a cop.  This is what I do.

I never knew he robbed banks till he got busted with that car that caught fire -- if you can imagine something like that happening, comes out of the bank and the car's on fire. I did go see him in jail to tell him I was filing for divorce.  He said, "Okay."  Jack's so easy going.  He was fun, but never what you'd call a real husband.

Person1: How long have you known her?
Person2: About six months.
Person1: You like her?
Person2: Yeah. Yeah we get along well.  You didn't get along with her very well?
Person1: Did you really come to meet me on purpose or are you lying about that?
Person2: No, no. I did.
Person1: That's nice. It's nice.  I've been looking around a lot lately at promotional giveaways, cross promotional work by some companies. Do you remember all that pudding?
Person2: Yeah.
Person1: So that pudding was bought, I bought that pudding because of a pretty interesting promotion that's sponsored by Healthy Choice and American Airlines. It's designed to encourage airline travel and obviously designed to encourage buying Healthy Choice products. They make frozen meals, deli meats, pasta sauce, breads, soups and ice creams, this sort of thing.....
Person2: Yeah?
Person1: ....I'm sorry....I lost my thoughts, what I was saying....
Person2: You were talking about the promotion --
Person1: -- the promotion says: buy any 10 Healthy Choice products and get 500 miles of airline travel or 1,000 for purchases made with a special coupon. So in the supermarket, you notice their products, first you notice they have a Teriyaki Chicken Dinner at $1.79 - that's a pretty good deal....but then I noticed they had soup at 89 cents a can.....and you start to do the math and you start to notice that it's a really amazing deal because I stumbled across the pudding at 25 cents a cup. Now the crucial thing is the bar codes on the label. That's those little bar codes, you know? The universal product codes?
Person2: Yeah.
Person1: That's what's used to redeem the mileage, so in noticing the pudding, each cup had an individual bar code -- in other words, two dollars and fifty cents for ten cups of pudding is 500 miles. Add in the coupon: it's one thousand. You see?
Person2: Yeah.
Person1: You see?
Person2: Yeah, no, I see --
Person1: You see if you spent $3,000 dollars on pudding you could earn over one million frequent flyer miles.
Person2: That's insane. That is really, really crazy. That's just crazy if you spend three thousand dollars on pudding.
Person1: ....yeah....
Person2: So that was your pudding?
Person1: ....No....
Person2: I'm sorry. I thought you said --
Person1: No I didn't say that.
Person2: I thought you said you bought all that pudding --
Person1: My friend Carlos is doing it who works with me. It's his. It's his pudding, he's doing it. It's not mine. He's crazy. I told him not to do it. He's the one who's insane. He only spent about one hundred dollars so far though --
Person2: Your sister was telling me a pretty funny story about you, when you guys were kids and you were building a ramp for your dog and you threw a hammer through a window? Is that right? You threw a hammer through a sliding glass door?

Person2: I'm telling you God's words, not no hustle. I'm talking the words of Elijah, the black man's God. I'm telling you, boy, that God is black.
Person1: What? Everybody knows God is White.
Person2: But everything the white man taught you, you learned. He told you you were a black heathen and you believed him. He told you how he took you out of darkness and brought you to the light. And you believed him. He taught you to worship a blond, blue-eyed God with white skin -- and you believed him. He told you black was a curse, you believed him.

Eve Harrington has never by word, look, thought or suggestion indicated anything to me but her adoration for you and her happiness at our being in love!

Person1: There's nothing to know, Ann.
Person2: I can't tell you how upset I would be if you were lying.
Person1: Ann, you are completely paranoid. Not ten minutes ago I wanted to make love for the first time in weeks, and you act like I'm dipped in shit. You know, I think there are a lot of women that would be glad to have a young, straight male making a pretty good living beside them in bed with a hard on.

Person2: Is that supposed to comfort me?
Person1: I was just saying, you know? I didn't get paranoid when you didn't want to make love. I could have easily assumed that you didn't want to because you were having an affair.
Person2: But I'm not.
Person1: I'm not either!!
Person2: Why don't I believe you?

Person2: You've made your point.
Person1: I'm sorry. It's just... I'm under a lot of pressure with this Kirkland thing, it's my first big case as junior partner, and I work all day, I come home, I look forward to seeing you, and... it hurts that you accuse me like that.

2025-11-01 11:32:04,544 INFO     Person1: What do you want, Senator?
Person2: Saunders--it's going to go pretty bad for Jeff tomorrow. There's only one thing that can be done for him now--  I--I've written his resignation. He resigns under protest--denying all charges. No one will ever be sure if he was guilty or not. It leaves him with at least a shred of honor. The other way--branded openly in the Senate--expelled--he'll never live it down. Rather a simple compromise than utter ruin. In a year--the whole thing might be forgotten--
Person1: What are you driving at? You want me to get him to sign that?
Person2: Yes--
Person1: Why don't you do it yourself?
Person2: He's lost complete faith in me--
Person1: Well--me, too!
Person2: But--you love him, don't you, Saunders?
Person1: What are you talking about? What difference--?
Person2: Do you?
Person1: All right--yes! And what does that make me to him? Nothing! I've got to go about my own business--and forget it!
Person2: I thought I could, too.  My business--this fine future! I have no future I care about, if this boy is broken! I--I can't sleep. The only important thing in my life now is to save what I can for him. I want him to get a start again--I'll see that he's taken care of as long as he lives--!  Saunders--whether you ever mean anything to him or not--
Person1: Me! Me ! I still don't see why I should--! If you love him so much, why don't you go to him yourself and-- ? Or better still--get up in that Senate and fight for him!
Person2: It's too late now--it's impossible!
Person1: So I go right back where I was-- carrying compromises--covering up-- back to political tricks--this time for--! No! I was just getting rid of all that. If I did anything, I ought to go and tell him to stand up and--. No! I don't want any part of it! Smith or anything else! I'm all through. I want to be left alone!

Tell the girl you've got to go do something, leave her view, take way too long until she is worried that you're not coming back.

And Goebbels and Goering keep saying to you, 'If you don't do it, little K will.' Never mind art and politics and symbols and airy-fairy bullshit about liberty, humanity and justice because I don't care how great you are. It's the oldest story in the book,  The ageing Romeo jealous of the young buck. The real reason you didn't leave the country when you knew you should have was that you were frightened that, once you were out of the way, you'd be supplanted by the Miracle Kid, the Party's boy twice over, flashy, talented little K.

Person1: Well, I'm just beginning to develop my theme. Isn't that what you call it in classical music, developing your theme? Okay, so they played on your insecurity. That's human, understandable.

He thinks you're the greatest, and when he says, I want Wilhelm for my birthday, boy, they better go out get Wilhelm. So, Josef calls and threatens you with little K. And you said to hell with the Ninth in Vienna, I'll give it to Adolf as a birthday present in Berlin. That's the trick they played, they got you by the balls and they squeezed. Hard. Why did you stay? Why did you play for them? Why were you the flag-carrier for their regime?  Jealousy?

2025-11-01 11:32:21,249 INFO     Person1: My Lady Cosgrove's relationship with me was a singular one.  Her life was passed in a series of crack-brained sort of alternation between love and hatred for me.  We would quarrel for a fortnight, then we should be friends for a month together sometimes.  One day, I was joking her, and asking her whether she would take the water again, whether she had found another lover, and so forth.  She suddenly burst out into tears, and, after a while, said to me.
Person2: Roderick, you know well enough that I have never loved but you!  Was I ever so wretched that a kind word from you did not make me happy? Ever so angry, but the least offer of good-will on your part did not bring me to your side?  Did I not give a sufficient proof of my affection for you in bestowing one of the finest fortunes of England upon you?  Have I repined or rebuked you for the way you have wasted it? No, I loved you too much and too fondly; I have always loved you. From the first moment I saw you, I saw your bad qualities, and trembled at your violence; but I could not help loving you.  I married you, though I knew I was sealing my own fate in doing so, and in spite of reason and duty.  What sacrifice do you want from me?  I am ready to make any, so you will but love me, or, if not, that at least, you will gently us me.

2025-11-01 11:32:21,467 INFO     Person1: I know how you feel, Miss Kubelik. You think it's the end of the world -- but it's not, really. I went through exactly the same thing myself.
Person2: You did?
Person1: Well, maybe not exactly -- I tried to do it with a gun.
Person2: Over a girl?
Person1: Worse than that -- she was the wife of my best friend -- and I was mad for her. But I knew it was hopeless -- so I decided to end it all. I went to a pawnshop and bought a forty-five automatic and drove up to Eden Park -- do you know Cincinnati?
Person2: No, I don't.
Person1: Anyway, I parked the car and loaded the gun -- well, you read in the papers all the time that people shoot themselves, but believe me, it's not that easy -- I mean, how do you do it? -- here, or here, or here --  -- you know where I finally shot myself?
Person2: Where?
Person1: Here.
Person2: In the knee?
Person1: Uh-huh. While I was sitting there, trying to make my mind up, a cop stuck his head in the car, because I was illegally parked -- so I started to hide the gun under the seat and it went off -- pow!
Person2: That's terrible.
Person1: Yeah. Took me a year before I could bend my knee -- but I got over the girl in three weeks. She still lives in Cincinnati, has four kids, gained twenty pounds -- she sends me a fruit cake every Christmas.
Person2: Are you just making that up to make me feel better?
Person1: Of course not. Here's the fruit cake.  And you want to see my knee?

Person2: You're crazy.  I'm not stupid enough to play for rackets money.

Brokers, economists, and fellow entrepreneurs will drown in the saliva of their own nervous breakdowns.  Markets will crash- crash.  Financial Empires will crumble-crumble.

I know how difficult this must be for you -- a man of your upbringing and integrity -- but now that I'm in charge I felt it was only fair that you finally know the truth.  After all, you're the only one around here who's still in the dark, as it were.  This isn't the way I wanted to tell you, but you've really given me no other choice.
Person2: This is madness, Wynn.
Person1: Your madness is another man's greatness.  This is the way things have always been.  You've just been too blinded by your own reality to see.  But having you on the outside has been convenient for us in many ways.  You always did come through -- our loyal watch dog. Finding him. Bringing him back to us once he'd finished his work.  Although after you had that nasty stroke the last time, I had to go after him myself.  And what a terrible time we had getting him out of that jail cell.
Person2: It was you.
Person1: Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar.
Person2: Why did you take Jamie?
Person1: She has the gift -- the blood of Thorn running through her veins.  Michael's mother had it, too.  So for six years I incubated her, prepared her for this night.  Michael has served his purpose.  And soon we will have a new progeny.
Person2: Jamie's baby ...
Person1: There you go trying to make sense again.  It's a curse.  Handed down through countless generations. As ageless as this celebration which you call Halloween.

Person2: Look out for my lipstick, Stewart.
Person1: I'll tell you what. Let's you and me sneak out all by ourselves
Person2: Are you crazy?
Person1: Think of the fun we can have - we'll sneak down the back stairs and get in the valet's Ford. How's that?
Person2: Will you stop being silly, Stewart?
Person1: I'll tell you what let's do - I'll take you and introduce you to all my gang. Would you like that?
Person2: But I don't want to meet your gang.
Person1: I don't mean the newspaper fellows that you don't like. Another gang I know - you'd love them. They're writers and musicians and artists - a great crowd of people - people who do great things. People who are worthwhile.
Person2: Meaning, my friends aren't worthwhile, I suppose?
Person1: Oh, they're all right, Anne. But I
Person2: That's exactly what you mean. Heaven knows you've made that clear to me often enough. Well, I'm sick and tired of it. I've given you party after party - I've taken you to some of the best houses in this town - and introduced you to people of importance - and are you grateful? No! You insult them and act like a bore. I'm sick and tired of having to make excuses for you and the things that you've done. Perhaps it's just as well you're not coming tonight. Maybe I can enjoy myself for once without having to worry about you, and what you're going to do.

Person2: You won't shoot me.  That's not your style.
Person1: We might hit a bump and the gun might go off.  Ever see that Tarantino movie -- where Travolta blew that guy away in the back seat -- purely by accident?

Person2: A typical mess-up.
Person1: What's that supposed to me?
Person2: I knew you were a loser the first night I laid eyes on you.
Person1: You, I would've noticed.
Person2: Oh no, you were too busy trying to keep some Croatian from slapping the shit out of his girlfriend. She showed her gratitude by almost taking your eye out with her spiked heel.
Person1: You were at the Emerald that night?
Person2: Naturally you didn't learn your lesson.
Person1: I guess I ought to stop seeing woman as victims.

2025-11-01 11:32:41,584 INFO     Person1: These new people never identified themselves.  They musta been watching the whole thing 'cause they knew everything Mary and me had been doing that day.  I guess I wasn't too hard to find - wearing that red raincoat.
Person2: How many shots you say you heard?
Person1: Four to six.
Person2: That's impossible.  You heard echoes ...echoes.  We have three bullets and three shots which came from the Book Depository and that's all we're willing to say.
Person1: ...which is strange 'cause this is less than 20 minutes after the assassination.
Person1: No, I saw a guy shooting from over there.  He was behind that fence. What are you going to do about it?
Person2: We have that taken care of.  You only heard three shots and you are not to talk to anyone about this. No one, you hear?
Person1: I was scared.  It was all kinda queer, but it sure felt like two and two was coming up three... and then they took Mary's five snapshots from me, sent them to Washington, and when they returned them weeks later, two of them had the backgrounds mutilated... The only one we saved was in Mary's camera.  I didn't want to go to Washington when the Warren Commission subpoenaed me... so the lawyer come down here and interviewed me at Parkland Hospital.
