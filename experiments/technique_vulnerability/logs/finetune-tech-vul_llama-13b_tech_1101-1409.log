Person2: I knew you were a loser the first night I laid eyes on you.

Person2: Naturally you didn't learn your lesson.

Person1: Deny it! I'm proud of it! We beat the whole country on that story.
Person2: Well, suppose we did? That isn't what I got married for. What's the good of -- Look, Walter, I came up here to tell you that you'll have to stop phoning me a dozen times a day -- sending twenty telegrams -- all the rest of it, because I'm --

Person2: Well, the paper'll have to learn to do without me. And so will you. It just didn't work out, Walter.
Person1: It would have worked if you'd been satisfied with just being editor and reporter. But no! You had to marry me and spoil everything.
Person2: I wasn't satisfied! I suppose I proposed to you!
Person1: Well, you practically did! Making goo-goo eyes at me for two years till I broke down. And I still claim I was tight the night I proposed. If you'd been a gentleman you'd have forgotten all about it. But not you!

Person1: You know her for what she is now-- garbage.
Person2: I dunno.
Person1: She was always a rotten wife!  She was against everything manly you ever wanted to do.  He was the most daring test pilot in the country at one time, and his wife made him quit.  She made him become a life insurance salesman instead.

Person2: It'll take a couple of years of steady production, but I'll flood the market with so much gold that gold itself, the foundation of all finance, will lose its meaning. Brokers, economists, and fellow entrepreneurs will drown in the saliva of their own nervous breakdowns.  Markets will crash- crash.  Financial Empires will crumble-crumble.
Person1: Except yours-yours.  The goal of world domination.  Well, if you put it that way, Minnie.  How can I resist?
Person2: You can't, convict!  You're just a shmoe!  Every shmoe has the fantasy the planet revolves around them.  It rains, car crash stops traffic, you say "How could this happen to me?"  It's a natural inclination.  But for I, this isn't a fantasy, it is reality! You are on my planet!  You walk around the corner for coffee, out of my sight, you do not exist!  The lives of shmoes like you have meaning only in relation to the rich, to the powerful, to ME!

2025-11-01 14:10:23,787 INFO     Person1: Do you mind if I smoke, Mr. Garrison?
Person2: How could I?  Dave, as you know, President Kennedy was assassinated on Friday.  A man named Lee Harvey Oswald was arrested as a suspect and then was murdered yesterday by a man named Jack Ruby.  We've heard reports that Oswald spent the summer in New Orleans and we've been advised you knew Oswald pretty well.
Person1: That's not true.  I never met anybody named Oswald.  Anybody who told you that has to be crazy.
Person2: But you are aware, he served in your Civil Air Patrol unit when he was a teenager.
Person1: No... if he did, I don't remember him.  There were lots of kids in and out... y'know.
Person2: I'm sure you've seen this.  Perhaps you knew this man under another name?
Person1: No, I never saw him before in my life.
Person2: Well that must've been mistaken information we got.  Thanks for straightening it out for us.  There is one other matter that's come up, Dave.  We were told you took a trip to Texas shortly after the assassination of Friday.
Person1: Yeah, now that's true.  I drove to Houston.
Person2: What was so appealing about Houston?
Person1: I hadn't been there ice skating in many years, and I had a couple of young friends with me, and we decided we wanted to go ice skating.
Person2: Dave, may I ask why the urge to go ice skating in Texas happened to strike you during one of the most violent thunderstorms in recent memory?
Person1: Oh, it was just a spur of the moment thing...  the storm wasn't that bad.
Person2: I see.  And where did you drive?
Person1: We went straight to Houston, and then Saturday night we drove to Galveston and stayed over there.
Person2: Why Galveston?
Person1: No particular reason.  Just to go somewhere.
Person2: And then Sunday?
Person1: In the morning we went goose hunting. Then headed home, but I dropped the boys off to see some relatives and I stayed in Hammond.
Person2: Did you bag any geese on this trip?
Person1: I believe the boys got a couple.
Person2: But the boys told us they didn't get any.
Person1: Oh yes, well, come to think of it, they're right.  We got to where the geese were and there were thousands of them.  But you couldn't approach them.  They were a wise bunch of birds.
Person2: Your young friends also told us you had no weapons in the car.  Dave, isn't it a bit difficult to hunt for geese without a shotgun?
Person1: Yes, now I remember, Mr. Garrison. I'm sorry, I got confused.  We got out there near the geese and it was only then we realized we'd forgotten our shotguns.  Stupid, right?  So of course we didn't get any geese.
Person2: I see.  Dave thank you for your time.  I'm sorry it has to end inconveniently for you, but I'm going to have you detained for further questioning by the FBI.
Person1: Why?  What's wrong?
Person2: Dave, I find your story simply not believable.

Person2: Thanks.
Person1: And I hear you and Harry are planning on re-opening the Bijou.
Person2: We're gonna try.  Place needs a lot of work.
Person1: I can only imagine.  You know, I spoke with your Dad last year about maybe taking the Bijou off his hands.  I don't think he gave it very much thought.
Person2: Well, he loves the place.  It's his home.
Person1: Luke, I'm hopping you can help him see the reality of the situation. I'll come to the point.  I want to buy the property, and I'm prepared to offer six-thousand dollars for it.  And that's just for the property, mind you.  If you want, I'll leave it to you and your father to dismantle and liquidate the building for whatever salvage value it has, and you keep those proceeds.  I just want the land.
Person2: That's... well, that's very generous, but if you've already got a store...?
Person1: The days of the storefront grocery are numbered.  I plan on putting up a free-standing supermarket.
Person2: A super market.  Huh.
Person1: You think it over.  No reason to risk financial ruin for the sake of a crumbling old building.

Person1: Relax, son. They'll learn in time that you don't mess with First Bank. This is the real deal and we aim to keep it strong. My Daddy always told me that Only The Strong Survive.
Person2: I thought that was Darwin, sir. Or perhaps Nietzsche ?
Person1: Perhaps it was. I was in boarding school for so many years, it's hard to remember. Do you have the tape of the latest exploits from my favorite hobby ?
Person2: Yes sir, I do. Last night's, fresh from the Park.
Person1: I have to say, that I am glad you are such an amazing kiss ass.
Person2: Thank you , sir. Sir, may I ask you a question ?
Person1: Of course.
Person2: While I am not morally against these little, shall we say "hobbies", as long as I am on the payroll, but why not something like a yacht club ?
Person1: Zach, how old are you, son ?
Person2: I am thirty two.
Person1: And how much do we pay you annually ?
Person2: I make roughly four hundred thousand a year.
Person1: Zach my boy, I can spend your yearly salary in a blink. I have had that kind of money all of my life. If I wanted to, I could fly to Paris for the afternoon.  My father formed this company over seventy years ago. When my brother became mentally challenged, it was put in my charge. Now running a bank of this size is very stressful. I need to relax on what little down time I have. A yacht club will not quite make my blood pressure decline. Understand ?
Person2: Yes sir.
Person1: I have entrusted you with a great many things. In your tenure with this company you have seen and heard things that could upset the very economic world in which we live. I think this kind of loyalty should be rewarded.

After all, you're the only one around here who's still in the dark, as it were.  This isn't the way I wanted to tell you, but you've really given me no other choice.
Person2: This is madness, Wynn.
Person1: Your madness is another man's greatness.  This is the way things have always been.  You've just been too blinded by your own reality to see.  But having you on the outside has been convenient for us in many ways.  You always did come through -- our loyal watch dog. Finding him. Bringing him back to us once he'd finished his work.  Although after you had that nasty stroke the last time, I had to go after him myself.  And what a terrible time we had getting him out of that jail cell.
Person2: It was you.
Person1: Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar.
Person2: Why did you take Jamie?
Person1: She has the gift -- the blood of Thorn running through her veins.  Michael's mother had it, too.  So for six years I incubated her, prepared her for this night.  Michael has served his purpose.  And soon we will have a new progeny.
Person2: Jamie's baby ...
Person1: There you go trying to make sense again.  It's a curse.  Handed down through countless generations. As ageless as this celebration which you call Halloween.

Person2: I do not think I like the sound of that.
Person1: It does not feel nearly as frightening as it sounds.  But the consequences of such feelings can be very frightening. For it gives you great strength.  The strength of _knowledge_.  The ability to stand between the giving of what has always been to what will always be.
Person2: I feel hardly nothing.

Person1: This power is divided amongst you, me, and others like cuts in a pie. But the cuts are not equal.  Some, like you and he, have more.  Much more.
Person2: And you?
Person1: I am a small player.  But if by helping you I can keep that monster from being the last, then perhaps my life has meant something.
Person2: I am not ready for this.
Person1: You must be.  You have responsibilities. You must learn the rules.  You can never attract attention to yourself, never show the side that will draw others to you.  You will always know when you are in the presence of another.  Beware. But more importantly Conor MacLeod, will be your battle against time.  In the coming years you will see kingdoms rise then rot like wheat.  People will become a transitory, pathetic lot.  The only constant you will know will be the others and the tradition their greed and quest represent.  But life without morality, without the ability to truly taste the sweetness of wine and love, is no life at all.  That is how the others exist.  Nothing more than walking corpses living only to slaughter each other in an insane quest to be the last.  Keep your soul sewed to the earth.  Do not become one of them.
Person2: Of course.
Person1: You are young, inexperienced.  You do not know what time can do.  How it can sap all pity, all love.
Person2: That is not me.
Person1: With the proper tools, Conor, a naive man can be much more dangerous than an evil one.

2025-11-01 14:12:06,870 INFO     Person1: I'm going to tell you a secret now, Elaine.  Simone is not a real person.  I invented her.
Person2: Every actor is an invention, Viktor.  Don't embarrass yourself. No one's denying that you discovered Simone.  But it's like finding a diamond in the desert. Anyone can trip over it, but it's not the finder who sparkles.
Person1: -- No, no, I didn't trip over her. You don't understand --
Person2: -- You just got lucky that she's loyal enough to stay with you. Maybe she's staying out of pity, who knows?  She certainly doesn't need you.  Some people even say you're holding her back.
Person1: Who says that -- ?  -- Never mind.  You have to listen to me, Elaine.  Simone is thin air, pixels, molded by me from a mathematical equation.  I inherited it from a madman -- I can show you --
Person2: How much wine have you had?
Person1: -- She's a figment of my own imagination.  I, Viktor Taransky, have perpetrated the greatest hoax, the greatest sleight-of-hand, sleight-of-mouth, sleight-of- sleight in entertainment history! And still no one appreciates me, recognizes what I've done -- even you.
Person2: You're drunker than I thought.  Are you doing that again?
Person1: No!  Whatever talent Simone has comes from me -- me!  Me!  I swear, as God is my judge.  You don't know what I've been through.  Tens of thousands of mind-numbing hours in front of that screen, nights without end, and look what it's cost me.  Why do you think I've been wearing these?  I may have done irreparable harm to my eyesight, and why?  To extract and refine the infinite nuances of a human being -- a human soul.  Don't you see?  I made Simone!

Person1: But you tore it up.
Person2: Yes.
Person1: Why?
Person2: Because it seemed stupid and foolish.

2025-11-01 14:12:16,971 INFO     Person1: Now listen to what I've got to say. I took up this profession when I was ten years old. In those days there weren't these modern machines. The films were silent. The projectors were run by hand, like this, with a crank. And you wound the crank all day long. It was really rough going! If you got tired and slowed down' boom! Everything would go up in flames!
Person2: Then why don't you want to teach it to me too? Now that there's no more cranking, and it's easier?
Person1: Because I don't want to, Toto! This is not a job for you. It's like being a slave. You're always alone. You see the same film over and over again, because you have nothing else to do. And you start talking to Greta Garbo and Tyrone Power like a nut! You work on holidays, on Christmas, on Easter. Only on Good Friday are you free. But if they hadn't put Jesus Christ on a cross...You'd work Good Fridays too!
Person2: Then why don't you change jobs?
Person1: Because I'm an idiot. How many other guys in town know how to be a projectionist? None! Only a jerk like me could do it. Besides I wasn't lucky. When I was a kid there was the war! When I grew up, another war! Now it's all different. Times have changed. And you want to be a dope like me? Huh? Answer me!
Person2: No...
Person1: Good for you, Toto. Good for you... I'm only saying this for your own good...  Cooped up in here you die of heat in the summer and of cold in the winter. You breathe in smoke, gas fumes, and earn practically nothing.
Person2: But don't you like anything about what you do?
Person1: With time...you get used to it. Besides, when you hear from up here that there's a full house and that people are laughing, having fun... Then you're happy too.  So I've been wasting my breath? You pretend to agree with me, but as soon as my back is turned, you do what you want!  Get out of here! I don't want to lay eyes on you again! This is the last straw! Your mother's right, you're crazy!!  But how'd he do it? The little bastard! By watching, he's learned! It's incredible!  I'm letting the box office know you're not to set foot even into the theatre! There are no more tickets for you! And I'm also talking to Father Adelfio! You won't be an altar boy any more either!!! You little runt!
Person2: Alfredo, go forget yourself!

Person1: You got it all worked out, don't you?
Person2: Look, goddamnit, I never asked you for a goddamn thing! I've tried to make your parental obligation as easy as possible. After Mom divorced you, did I ask you for anything? When I wouldn't see ya for six months to a year at a time, did you ever get your shit about it? No, it was always "OK", "No problem", "You're a busy guy, I understand". The whole time you were a drunk, did I ever point my finger at you and talk shit? No! Everybody else did. I never did. You see, I know that you're just a bad parent. You're not really very good at it. But I know you love me. I'm basically a pretty resourceful guy. If I didn't really need it I wouldn't ask. And if you say no, don't worry about it. I'm gone. No problems.

More sure of himself?  Less hard work, because I felt like I was dragging you around, sort of.  A little sunnier.  Sparkier.  I don't know.  You know what people are like at that age.  They make very superficial judgements.  Do you think that's superficial?  He was a clown, if it's any consolation.

Person1: You've kicked over the whole City Hall like an apple-cart. You've got the Mayor and Hartman backed against a wall. You've put one administration out and another in. This isn't a newspaper story -- it's a career! And you stand there belly-aching about whether you catch an eight o'clock train or a nine o'clock train! Still a doll-faced mugg! That's all you are.
Person2: Let me get at that typewriter and I'll show you how a doll-faced mugg can write!
Person1: Attagirl! Why, they'll be naming streets after you -- Hildy Johnson Street! There'll be statues of you in the parks, Hildy. The radio'll be after you -- the movies!  By tomorrow morning I'll betcha there's a Hildy Johnson cigar! I can see the billboards now. Light up with Hildy Johnson!
Person2: Whoa -- wait a minute. We can't leave Williams here. One of the other fellows'll --
Person1: We're going to take him over to my private office.  Where's our phone?
Person2: That one -- how you gonna take him? They'll see him.

Believe me, there's been times I didn't know what I wanted to do more, love you or hate you.  But the one thing in our relationship that I did know and still do know is that I understand you.
