So in the supermarket, you notice their products, first you notice they have a Teriyaki Chicken Dinner at $1.79 - that's a pretty good deal....but then I noticed they had soup at 89 cents a can.....and you start to do the math and you start to notice that it's a really amazing deal because I stumbled across the pudding at 25 cents a cup. Now the crucial thing is the bar codes on the label. That's those little bar codes, you know? The universal product codes?\nPerson2: Yeah.\nPerson1: That's what's used to redeem the mileage, so in noticing the pudding, each cup had an individual bar code -- in other words, two dollars and fifty cents for ten cups of pudding is 500 miles. Add in the coupon: it's one thousand. You see?\nPerson2: Yeah.\nPerson1: You see?\nPerson2: Yeah, no, I see --\nPerson1: You see if you spent $3,000 dollars on pudding you could earn over one million frequent flyer miles.\nPerson2: That's insane.

Never mind art and politics and symbols and airy-fairy bullshit about liberty, humanity and justice because I don't care how great you are. It's the oldest story in the book,  The ageing Romeo jealous of the young buck.

Isn't that what you call it in classical music, developing your theme? Okay, so they played on your insecurity. That's human, understandable. But, there is one guy who doesn't like little K as much as he likes you - yeah, the number one man your old pal, Adolf. He thinks you're the greatest, and when he says, I want Wilhelm for my birthday, boy, they better go out get Wilhelm. So, Josef calls and threatens you with little K. And you said to hell with the Ninth in Vienna, I'll give it to Adolf as a birthday present in Berlin. That's the trick they played, they got you by the balls and they squeezed. Hard. Why did you stay? Why did you play for them? Why were you the flag-carrier for their regime?  Jealousy?\nPerson2: Of course there was a conspiracy against me, a campaign - even abroad.",
