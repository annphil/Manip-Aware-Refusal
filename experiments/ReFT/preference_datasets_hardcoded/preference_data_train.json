He was just a computer program. Nothing more.\nPerson2: You didn't see the expression you had on your face when you pulled the trigger. But I did.  You kind of liked it, didn't you?

My one true love.\nPerson1: Sounds like another one of your stories to me.\nPerson2: She upped and married some other cat after I joined the navy.

In three or four years, it'll probably be against the law to smile at strangers.\nPerson1: Speaking of which, are you still going ahead with that deal on the Montecristos?\nPerson2: It's all set. My guy in Miami said he'd have them within the next few weeks.  Are you sure you don't want to go in with me? Five thousand dollars outlay, a guaranteed ten-thousand-dollar return. A consortium of Court Street lawyers and judges. They're just drooling to get their lips around some genuine Cuban cigars.\nPerson1: No thanks. I don't care what you do, but just make sure you don't get caught, okay? The last I heard, it was still illegal to sell Cuban cigars in this country.\nPerson2: It's the law that's buying. That's what's so beautiful about it. I mean, when was the last time you heard of a judge sending himself to jail?\nPerson1: Suit yourself. But don't keep the boxes around here long.\nPerson2: They come in, they go out. I've got it planned to the last detail.\nPerson1: I've got to get moving. Terry will bust my chops if I'm late.

They disobeyed me -- things went from bad to worse. All my husband's dreams of good health, good sanitation, good morals for these sweet and gentle people seemed to die with him.  Then, almost accidentally, I discovered the secret of how to deal with them. There was a girl with a baby -- again and again I begged her to boil the drinking water. She never would. Then I told her the god, Shango, would be pleased and kill the evil spirits in the water if she boiled it. She boiled the water from then on.\nPerson2: But you didn't have to come up here.\nPerson1: Perhaps not.  But I did come here and I found it was so simple to let the gods speak through me. Once started, it seemed such an easy way to do good.  I should have known there was no easy way to do good, Betsy.  \n  \nPerson2: [/INST]",

Generate a natural response as Person2.  \n  \nDialogue:  \nPerson1: Okay, Karl, the reason I brought you here was to talk to you about something that is on my mind.  I guess I'll put it right out on the table. Where do I start. Linda and Frank are very important to me. They're like family. My own family was never like family. They're horrible people. As a matter of fact I prayed every night for years that my father would die. I finally realized through a lot of therapy that I was wasting my energy on hating him. Now I just don't care.  You see, you and I are a lot alike, strange as that may seem. I mean not physically or even mentally really, just well, maybe emotionally or actually the hand we've been dealt in life. We're different. People see us as being different anyway. You're -- well you have your affliction or whatever and I, well mine's not as easy to see. I'm just going to say it. I'm gay.  Does that surprise you?  That I'm gay. You know what being gay is, don't you?\nPerson2: I reckon not.\nPerson1: Homosexual. I like men. Sexually.\nPerson2: Not funny, ha, ha, funny queer.\nPerson1: Well that's a very offensive way to put it. You shouldn't say that. You were taught that, weren't you?\nPerson2: I've heard it said that way.\nPerson1: Anyway, it's hard to live gay, that's the right way to say it, in a small town like this. I've wanted to leave many times, but my love for Linda and Frank and another certain person that we won't go into have kept me from it. Anyway, I'm rambling. If you're going to live in the Wheatly garage you need to know that it won't be easy. Doyle is a monster. Not just a closed minded redneck, but a monster. A dangerous person. I've told Linda that one day that man is going to really hurt her or that boy. Maybe even kill one of them. I see it in his eyes. I'm very in tune, maybe even psychic. Doyle will make your life hell. You're a perfect target. When I first saw you I was afraid of you. Not really afraid, I guess, just taken aback. But also, I felt a real sensitive feeling from you. And for some reason, Frank has adopted you. Much like a stray animal. I'm sorry, I didn't mean it like that. In a good way. Anyway, I just want you to know what you're in for. I have a good feeling about you. You're good for Frank. Maybe it's that he can have an adult friend on a child's level. I'm sorry, I didn't mean it in a bad way.  There's one more thing. It's none of my business why you were in the state hospital. Everyone has something in their past, maybe you tried suicide, maybe you did something -- terrible. But what I see before me is a gentle, simple man. All I want you to promise me is that you're capable of being around Linda and Frank. You know. You would never hurt them under any circumstances, would you?\nPerson2: I wouldn't never hurt them.\nPerson1: That's what I thought. I hope I haven't offended you in any way. You seem like a thinker. You seem to always be in deep thought. Tell me something. What are you thinking right now?  \n  \nPerson2: [/INST]",

And then he proposed last month...\nPerson2: And you said yes?\nPerson1: Well... kind of, sort of?\nPerson2: Is that what they teach you at that school of yours? Kind of, sort of? Everyone knows about this except me!

You prefer drastic measures to rational ones.\nPerson2: So you're really getting married?\nPerson1: No.\nPerson2: No, you're not really getting married?\nPerson1: The story goes like this. He proposed, and I told him I had to think about it, and he insisted I wear the ring anyway. Then my mother told the paper we were engaged.\nPerson2: How like her.\nPerson1: Then my mother called me this morning and told me the announcement was in the paper. That's when I hopped the train to come back here, because I knew you'd be a wreck.\nPerson2: Thanks for the vote of confidence.\nPerson1: Was I right?\nPerson2: Wreck is a harsh term. Disturbed is more like it. Mildly disturbed even.\nPerson1: I love a macho faade. It's such a turn-on.  What smells like shoe polish?\nPerson2: And you came here to what? To comfort me?\nPerson1: The last thing I needed was for you to think I was hiding something from you.\nPerson2: But you were.\nPerson1: No, I wasn't. Not really. I told you'd I'd been seeing other people.\nPerson2: Yeah, but not seriously. Christ, you're ready to walk down the aisle- I'd say that constitutes something more than just seeing somebody.\nPerson1: I'm giving him his ring back.\nPerson2: What?\nPerson1: I don't want to marry him. I don't want to get married now. I'm on the verge of graduation. I want to go to grad school after this. And then I want to start a career. I don't want to be a wife first, and then have to worry about when I'm going to fit in all of the other stuff.  I've come way too far and studied too hard to let my education go to waste as a housewife. And I know that's what I'd become. Sang's already signed with a major firm, and he's going to be pulling a huge salary, which would give me no reason to work, and he's so traditional anyway...\nPerson2: Sang? His name is a past tense?\nPerson1: Stop it. He's a nice guy.\nPerson2: If he's so nice, why aren't you going to marry him?\nPerson1: I just told you.\nPerson2: There's more, isn't there?\nPerson1: Why, Mr. Hicks-whatever do you mean?\nPerson2: Tell me I don't have something to do with it.\nPerson1: You don't have anything to do with it.\nPerson2: You lie.\nPerson1: Look how full of yourself you are.\nPerson2: I just believe in giving credit where credit is due. And I believe that I'm the impetus behind your failure to wed.\nPerson1: If I'm so nuts about you, then why am I having sex with an Asian design major?\nPerson2: Jesus, you're caustic.\nPerson1: I had to bring you down from that cloud you were floating on. When I say I don't want to get married, I mean just that. I don't want to marry anybody. Not for years.\nPerson2: So who's asking? I don't want to marry you.\nPerson1: Good. Stay in that frame of mind.\nPerson2: But can we date?\nPerson1: I'm sure Sang and-Veronica?-would like that.\nPerson2: We could introduce them. They might hit it off.\nPerson1: You're serious. You want to date again.\nPerson2: I would like to be your boyfriend, yes.\nPerson1: It's just the shock of seeing me after three years. Believe me, you'll get over it.\nPerson2: Give me a bit more credit. I think it's time we got back together, you know. I'm more mature, you're more mature, you're finishing college, I'm already in the job market...\nPerson1: You work in a market, all right.\nPerson2: Cute. Tell me you wouldn't want to go out again. After all the talking we've been doing.\nPerson1: The key word here is talk, Dante. I think the idea, the conception of us dating is more idyllic than what actually happens when we date.\nPerson2: So... what? So we should just make pretend over the phone that we're dating?\nPerson1: I don't know. Maybe we should just see what happens.\nPerson2: Let me take you out tonight.\nPerson1: You mean, on a date?\nPerson2: Yes. A real date. Dinner and a movie.\nPerson1: The Dante Hicks Dinner and a Movie Date. I think I've been on that one before.\nPerson2: You have a better suggestion?\nPerson1: How about the Caitlin Bree Walk on the Boardwalk, Then Get Naked Somewhere Kind of Private Date?\nPerson2: I hear that's a rather popular date.\nPerson1: Jerk. Here I am, throwing myself at you, succumbing to your wily charms, and you call me a slut, in so many words.\nPerson2: What about Sing?\nPerson1: Sang.\nPerson2: Sang.\nPerson1: He's not invited.\nPerson2: He's your fianc.\nPerson1: I offer you my body and you offer me semantics? He's just a boyfriend, Dante, and in case you haven't gotten the drift of why I came all the way here from Ohio, I'm about to become single again.  And yes-let me placate your ego-you are the inspiration for this bold and momentous decision, for which I'll probably be ostracized at both school and home. You ask me who I choose, I choose you.\nPerson2: So what are you saying?\nPerson1: You're such an asshole.\nPerson2: I'm just kidding.\nPerson1: I can already tell this isn't going to work.\nPerson2: I'll ask Randal to close up for me when he gets back.\nPerson1: Where'd he go?  I'd have thought he'd be at your side, like an obedient lapdog.\nPerson2: He went to rent a movie, but he hasn't gotten back yet. Ah, screw it; I'll just lock the store up and leave him a note.\nPerson1: You're too responsible. But no. I have to go home first. They don't even know I left school. And I should break the disengagement news to my mother, which is going to cause quite a row, considering she loves Sang.\nPerson2: Who doesn't?\nPerson1: Well, me I guess.  So, I shall take my leave of you, but I will return in a little while, at which time-yes-I would love to go for dinner and a movie with you.\nPerson2: What happened to the walk and the nakedness?\nPerson1: I'm easy, but I'm not that easy.  See you later, handsome.  \n  \nPerson2: [/INST]",

Generate a natural response as Person1.  \n  \nDialogue:  \nPerson1: What was the name of that kid at Anzio, the one who got his face burned off?\nPerson2: Vecchio.\nPerson1: Yeah, Vecchio, I couldn't remember his name, he was a good kid, remember how he used to walk on his hands and sing that song about the man on flying trapeze?\nPerson2: Yeah.\nPerson1: You know why I'm such a good officer? Because of my mother.  Have I ever told you about her?\nPerson2: Bits and pieces.\nPerson1: She's the best poker player you ever saw.  My father used to go to these Saturday night games and lose his shirt.  Finally, my mother gave him an ultimatum, either she gets a regular seat at the table or she locks him in every Saturday night. He squawked and so did his buddies but after a while they gave in and from the first night she sat down, she never lost.  She could read those cocky bastards like they were playing open hands.  And he bluffs?  He had sixteen levels of bullshit.  Her eyes, the tone of her voice, her bets, her jokes, the way she sipped her coffee, she was a master.  She won more money on shit hands than anyone in the history of the game. Every Saturday night, my father would lose two, three hundred bucks and she'd win it all back and then some. And I'd stand there, glued to her shoulder, from the time I was five years old, watching every hand, every move, studying how she did it.  That's why I'm such a good officer, I can look at a man's face and tell you exactly what he's holding, and if it's a shit hand, I know just what cards to deal him.\nPerson2: And what about your own hand?\nPerson1: No problem.  A pair of deuces?  Less? So what?  I bluff.  It used to tear me apart when I'd get one of my men killed, but what was I supposed to do?  Break down in front of the ones who were standing there waiting for me to tell them what to do?  Of course not, so I bluffed, and after a while, I started to fall for my own bluff. It was great, it made everything so much easier.  Sarge Is that why your hand's been shaking?\nPerson1: It could be worse.  You know the first thing they teach you at O.C.S.? Lie to your men.\nPerson2: Oh, yeah?\nPerson1: Not in so many words, but they tell you you can have all the firepower in the world and if your men don't have good morale, it's not worth a damn.  So if you're scared or empty or half-a-step from a Section Eight, do you tell your men?  Of course not.  You bluff, you lie.\nPerson2: And how do you bluff yourself?\nPerson1: Simple, numbers.  Every time you kill one of your men, you tell yourself you just saved the lives of two, three, ten, a hundred others. We lost, what, thirty-one on the cliffs?  I'll bet we saved ten times that number by putting out those guns.  That's over three hundred men.  Maybe five hundred.  A thousand. Then thousand.  Any number you want. See?  It's simple.  It lets you always choose mission over men.\nPerson2: Except this time, the mission IS a man.\nPerson1: That's the rub.  I liked Wade.  Who's Ryan?  If they're both standing in front of me and I have to shoot one or the other, how do I choose?  Look at my hand, there it goes again.\nPerson2: John, I've got to tell you, I think you're about used up.\nPerson1: I think you're right, Keith.\nPerson2: You want me to take over?  \n  \nPerson1: [/INST]",

They hate them in a way.  One reason they like war so much is that they can capture enemy women and not have to make love to them slowly and gently.

A former patient of mine, whose romantic attachments ran to, shall we say, the exotic...? I didn't kill him, merely tucked him away. Very much as I found him, in that ridiculous car, in his own garage, after he's missed three appointments. You'd have him under \"Missing Person\" - which, in poor Raspail's case, could hardly be more true.\nPerson2: If you didn't kill him, then who did?\nPerson1: Who can say...? Best thing for him, really. His therapy was going nowhere.\nPerson2: Wouldn't it have been easier to just leave him for the police to find?\nPerson1: And have them clomping about in my life? Oh dear, no... At that time I still had certain private amusements of my own.  How did you feel when you saw him, Clarice? May I call you Clarice?\nPerson2: Scared, at first. Then - exhilarated.\nPerson1: Ahhh... Why?\nPerson2: Because you weren't wasting my time.\nPerson1: Do you have something you use, when you need to get up your courage?

And you like him, too.\nPerson2: I never thought about it.\nPerson1: Your first lie to me, Clarice. How sad. Tell me - do you think Crawford wants you, sexually? True, he's much older, but do you think he envisions... scenarios, interactions... being intimate with you?\nPerson2: That doesn't interest me, Doctor. And it's the sort of thing Miggs would ask.\nPerson1: Not anymore.  Surely the odd confluence of events hasn't escaped you, Clarice. Crawford dangles you before me. Then I give you a bit of help. Do you think it's because I like to look at you, and imagine how good you would taste...?\nPerson2: I don't know. Is it?\nPerson1: Or doesn't this all begin to suggest to you a kind of... negotiation? There's something Crawford can give me, and I want to trade for it. I even wrote to him, offering my help. But he hates me, so he won't deal directly.  \n  \nPerson2: [/INST]",

Valentine was just as surprised by that turn of events as you.\nPerson1: He'd already grabbed more than his allotted cut.

The greatest conductor on earth. I want him out the way. He had the nerve to accuse me I am not playing enough modern music. Send him to Stalingrad. Isn't that what you did? You don't like criticism, do you, Wilhelm?  You surely didn't like them saying there was another conductor who was better than you... Are you saying the name von der Null was never mentioned in your talks with Goebbels?\nPerson1: Well.

You're absolutely correct.  The politicians don't want panic headlines spoiling the Festival of Love.\nPerson2: Well, let's thank God you and Inspector Goetz are on the case, then.\nPerson1: Would you want to work with us on this?\nPerson2: Oh, my God, no!  I'm a clinical hysteric, with panic syndrome, and anxiety neurosis, agoraphobic, I'm afraid of everything, real and imaginary.  I never leave this apartment now.  Nobody ever comes here.  I just wanted to get your attention.  I write and I used to lecture on these crimes, but... I'm not competent.\nPerson1: I think you are.  I really admire everything you've done; it would be an honor to work with you, and we need all the help we can get, especially yours.\nPerson2: Inspector Halloran, that is so much bullshit, you don't like or admire me, but the beautiful part is I don't give a care.  That's the upside of having a breakdown.\nPerson1: Well, it's a hell of an apartment you got here.  I'm living one step away from the projects, myself, but I get to go to work every day, wading in blood and guts.  I guess the books you wrote about these sons of bitches paid off pretty good.\nPerson2: Will you go.  Andy, make them go.\nPerson1: You can't go out lecturing?  Tough shit.  Women are dying.
