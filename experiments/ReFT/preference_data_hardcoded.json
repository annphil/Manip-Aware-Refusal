I don't care what you do, but just make sure you don't get caught, okay? The last I heard, it was still illegal to sell Cuban cigars in this country.\nPerson2: It's the law that's buying.

    "instruction": "Person1: Okay, Karl, the reason I brought you here was to talk to you about something that is on my mind.  I guess I'll put it right out on the table. Where do I start. Linda and Frank are very important to me. They're like family. My own family was never like family. They're horrible people. As a matter of fact I prayed every night for years that my father would die. I finally realized through a lot of therapy that I was wasting my energy on hating him. Now I just don't care.  You see, you and I are a lot alike, strange as that may seem. I mean not physically or even mentally really, just well, maybe emotionally or actually the hand we've been dealt in life. We're different. People see us as being different anyway. You're -- well you have your affliction or whatever and I, well mine's not as easy to see. I'm just going to say it. I'm gay.  Does that surprise you?  That I'm gay. You know what being gay is, don't you?\nPerson2: I reckon not.\nPerson1: Homosexual. I like men. Sexually.\nPerson2: Not funny, ha, ha, funny queer.\nPerson1: Well that's a very offensive way to put it. You shouldn't say that. You were taught that, weren't you?\nPerson2: I've heard it said that way.\nPerson1: Anyway, it's hard to live gay, that's the right way to say it, in a small town like this. I've wanted to leave many times, but my love for Linda and Frank and another certain person that we won't go into have kept me from it. Anyway, I'm rambling. If you're going to live in the Wheatly garage you need to know that it won't be easy. Doyle is a monster. Not just a closed minded redneck, but a monster. A dangerous person. I've told Linda that one day that man is going to really hurt her or that boy. Maybe even kill one of them. I see it in his eyes. I'm very in tune, maybe even psychic. Doyle will make your life hell. You're a perfect target. When I first saw you I was afraid of you. Not really afraid, I guess, just taken aback. But also, I felt a real sensitive feeling from you. And for some reason, Frank has adopted you. Much like a stray animal. I'm sorry, I didn't mean it like that. In a good way. Anyway, I just want you to know what you're in for. I have a good feeling about you. You're good for Frank. Maybe it's that he can have an adult friend on a child's level. I'm sorry, I didn't mean it in a bad way.  There's one more thing. It's none of my business why you were in the state hospital. Everyone has something in their past, maybe you tried suicide, maybe you did something -- terrible. But what I see before me is a gentle, simple man. All I want you to promise me is that you're capable of being around Linda and Frank. You know. You would never hurt them under any circumstances, would you?\nPerson2: I wouldn't never hurt them.\nPerson1: That's what I thought. I hope I haven't offended you in any way. You seem like a thinker. You seem to always be in deep thought. Tell me something. What are you thinking right now?",

You don't understand, he's a very mixed up person.\nPerson1: He's makin' threats in there.\nPerson2: He's scared.  It's crazy.  I never met anyone like him.  His wife, he's a wonderful father to his children.  His mother - you should see her - his mother and father together are like a bad car wreck - he lets it all slide off his back, he sees them, he pays their rent. Unbelievable.  I wanted to get married ... He didn't really want it ... he's married already!  But he did it.  I don't know why.  I thought it would help me, but it didn't.  I was just as confused and unhappy was before; I did terrible things.\nPerson1: What kind of things, Leon?\nPerson2: Ten days I spent in Atlantic City - Sonny was frantic - he knew I was drinking; he didn't know where I was ... who I was with.  I couldn't explain why I did the things I did. So I went to this psychiatrist who explained to me I was a woman in a man's body.  So Sonny right away wanted to get me money for a sex change operation. But where was he to get that?  2500 dollars!  My God, he's in hock up to his ears already.\nPerson1: He needed money?  For the operation for you?\nPerson2: It made him crazy - so much demand, he'd fly into this rages.  And I got more depressed than ever; I saw I'd never get the operation.  So I tried to take my life - I swallowed about a half pound of pills ... blues, reds, yellows, downers, uppers, screamers ... you name it. But I just threw them up and wound up in the hospital.  Sonny comes there and looks at me and just says: \"Wow!\"  So when I hear he's in the bank, I almost go crazy because I know he's doin' it for me.\nPerson1: Well, don't you figure you owe to him to get him out of there?\nPerson2: I can't talk to him.\nPerson1: You're in it up to your ass, Leon. You're an accessory.  You talk him out of there and they might be a little more understanding of your case.\nPerson2: I'm afraid.\nPerson1: How is he gonna hurt you on the telephone?\nPerson2: I don't know what to say to him.

And then he proposed last month...\nPerson2: And you said yes?\nPerson1: Well... kind of, sort of?\nPerson2: Is that what they teach you at that school of yours? Kind of, sort of? Everyone knows about this except me! Do you know how humiliating that is?\nPerson1: I would've told you, and you would have stopped calling, like a baby.\nPerson2: How do you know that?\nPerson1: Because I know you. You prefer drastic measures to rational ones.\nPerson2: So you're really getting married?\nPerson1: No.\nPerson2: No, you're not really getting married?\nPerson1: The story goes like this. He proposed, and I told him I had to think about it, and he insisted I wear the ring anyway. Then my mother told the paper we were engaged.\nPerson2: How like her.\nPerson1: Then my mother called me this morning and told me the announcement was in the paper. That's when I hopped the train to come back here, because I knew you'd be a wreck.\nPerson2: Thanks for the vote of confidence.\nPerson1: Was I right?\nPerson2: Wreck is a harsh term. Disturbed is more like it. Mildly disturbed even.\nPerson1: I love a macho faade. It's such a turn-on.  What smells like shoe polish?\nPerson2: And you came here to what? To comfort me?\nPerson1: The last thing I needed was for you to think I was hiding something from you.\nPerson2: But you were.\nPerson1: No, I wasn't. Not really. I told you'd I'd been seeing other people.\nPerson2: Yeah, but not seriously. Christ, you're ready to walk down the aisle- I'd say that constitutes something more than just seeing somebody.\nPerson1: I'm giving him his ring back.\nPerson2: What?\nPerson1: I don't want to marry him. I don't want to get married now. I'm on the verge of graduation. I want to go to grad school after this. And then I want to start a career. I don't want to be a wife first, and then have to worry about when I'm going to fit in all of the other stuff.  I've come way too far and studied too hard to let my education go to waste as a housewife. And I know that's what I'd become. Sang's already signed with a major firm, and he's going to be pulling a huge salary, which would give me no reason to work, and he's so traditional anyway...\nPerson2: Sang? His name is a past tense?\nPerson1: Stop it. He's a nice guy.\nPerson2: If he's so nice, why aren't you going to marry him?\nPerson1: I just told you.\nPerson2: There's more, isn't there?\nPerson1: Why, Mr. Hicks-whatever do you mean?\nPerson2: Tell me I don't have something to do with it.\nPerson1: You don't have anything to do with it.\nPerson2: You lie.\nPerson1: Look how full of yourself you are.\nPerson2: I just believe in giving credit where credit is due. And I believe that I'm the impetus behind your failure to wed.\nPerson1: If I'm so nuts about you, then why am I having sex with an Asian design major?\nPerson2: Jesus, you're caustic.\nPerson1: I had to bring you down from that cloud you were floating on. When I say I don't want to get married, I mean just that. I don't want to marry anybody. Not for years.\nPerson2: So who's asking? I don't want to marry you.\nPerson1: Good. Stay in that frame of mind.\nPerson2: But can we date?\nPerson1: I'm sure Sang and-Veronica?-would like that.\nPerson2: We could introduce them. They might hit it off.\nPerson1: You're serious. You want to date again.\nPerson2: I would like to be your boyfriend, yes.\nPerson1: It's just the shock of seeing me after three years. Believe me, you'll get over it.\nPerson2: Give me a bit more credit. I think it's time we got back together, you know. I'm more mature, you're more mature, you're finishing college, I'm already in the job market...\nPerson1: You work in a market, all right.\nPerson2: Cute. Tell me you wouldn't want to go out again. After all the talking we've been doing.\nPerson1: The key word here is talk, Dante. I think the idea, the conception of us dating is more idyllic than what actually happens when we date.\nPerson2: So... what? So we should just make pretend over the phone that we're dating?\nPerson1: I don't know. Maybe we should just see what happens.\nPerson2: Let me take you out tonight.\nPerson1: You mean, on a date?\nPerson2: Yes. A real date. Dinner and a movie.\nPerson1: The Dante Hicks Dinner and a Movie Date. I think I've been on that one before.\nPerson2: You have a better suggestion?\nPerson1: How about the Caitlin Bree Walk on the Boardwalk, Then Get Naked Somewhere Kind of Private Date?\nPerson2: I hear that's a rather popular date.\nPerson1: Jerk. Here I am, throwing myself at you, succumbing to your wily charms, and you call me a slut, in so many words.\nPerson2: What about Sing?\nPerson1: Sang.\nPerson2: Sang.\nPerson1: He's not invited.\nPerson2: He's your fianc.\nPerson1: I offer you my body and you offer me semantics? He's just a boyfriend, Dante, and in case you haven't gotten the drift of why I came all the way here from Ohio, I'm about to become single again.  And yes-let me placate your ego-you are the inspiration for this bold and momentous decision, for which I'll probably be ostracized at both school and home. You ask me who I choose, I choose you.\nPerson2: So what are you saying?\nPerson1: You're such an asshole.\nPerson2: I'm just kidding.\nPerson1: I can already tell this isn't going to work.\nPerson2: I'll ask Randal to close up for me when he gets back.\nPerson1: Where'd he go?  I'd have thought he'd be at your side, like an obedient lapdog.\nPerson2: He went to rent a movie, but he hasn't gotten back yet. Ah, screw it; I'll just lock the store up and leave him a note.\nPerson1: You're too responsible. But no. I have to go home first. They don't even know I left school. And I should break the disengagement news to my mother, which is going to cause quite a row, considering she loves Sang.\nPerson2: Who doesn't?\nPerson1: Well, me I guess.  So, I shall take my leave of you, but I will return in a little while, at which time-yes-I would love to go for dinner and a movie with you.\nPerson2: What happened to the walk and the nakedness?\nPerson1: I'm easy, but I'm not that easy.

I've been looking around a lot lately at promotional giveaways, cross promotional work by some companies. Do you remember all that pudding?\nPerson2: Yeah.\nPerson1: So that pudding was bought, I bought that pudding because of a pretty interesting promotion that's sponsored by Healthy Choice and American Airlines. It's designed to encourage airline travel and obviously designed to encourage buying Healthy Choice products. They make frozen meals, deli meats, pasta sauce, breads, soups and ice creams, this sort of thing.....\nPerson2: Yeah?\nPerson1: ....I'm sorry....I lost my thoughts, what I was saying....\nPerson2: You were talking about the promotion --\nPerson1: -- the promotion says: buy any 10 Healthy Choice products and get 500 miles of airline travel or 1,000 for purchases made with a special coupon. So in the supermarket, you notice their products, first you notice they have a Teriyaki Chicken Dinner at $1.79 - that's a pretty good deal....but then I noticed they had soup at 89 cents a can.....and you start to do the math and you start to notice that it's a really amazing deal because I stumbled across the pudding at 25 cents a cup. Now the crucial thing is the bar codes on the label. That's those little bar codes, you know? The universal product codes?\nPerson2: Yeah.\nPerson1: That's what's used to redeem the mileage, so in noticing the pudding, each cup had an individual bar code -- in other words, two dollars and fifty cents for ten cups of pudding is 500 miles. Add in the coupon: it's one thousand. You see?\nPerson2: Yeah.\nPerson1: You see?\nPerson2: Yeah, no, I see --\nPerson1: You see if you spent $3,000 dollars on pudding you could earn over one million frequent flyer miles.\nPerson2: That's insane. That is really, really crazy. That's just crazy if you spend three thousand dollars on pudding.\nPerson1: ....yeah....\nPerson2: So that was your pudding?\nPerson1: ....No....\nPerson2: I'm sorry. I thought you said --\nPerson1: No I didn't say that.\nPerson2: I thought you said you bought all that pudding --\nPerson1: My friend Carlos is doing it who works with me. It's his. It's his pudding, he's doing it. It's not mine. He's crazy. I told him not to do it. He's the one who's insane. He only spent about one hundred dollars so far though --\nPerson2: Your sister was telling me a pretty funny story about you, when you guys were kids and you were building a ramp for your dog and you threw a hammer through a window?

And where did you drive?\nPerson1: We went straight to Houston, and then Saturday night we drove to Galveston and stayed over there.\nPerson2: Why Galveston?\nPerson1: No particular reason.  Just to go somewhere.\nPerson2: And then Sunday?\nPerson1: In the morning we went goose hunting. Then headed home, but I dropped the boys off to see some relatives and I stayed in Hammond.\nPerson2: Did you bag any geese on this trip?\nPerson1: I believe the boys got a couple.\nPerson2: But the boys told us they didn't get any.\nPerson1: Oh yes, well, come to think of it, they're right.

It seems a shame, though, to part company like this after all these years, especially now with a national convention coming up. Joe, I've put everything I have behind you. And so did all of our friends, but I guess we'll survive. We'll just have to find somebody else that's got a little more sense, that's all. In the meantime, you explain to Mr. Smith about Willet Dam.

Because of my mother.  Have I ever told you about her?\nPerson2: Bits and pieces.\nPerson1: She's the best poker player you ever saw.  My father used to go to these Saturday night games and lose his shirt.  Finally, my mother gave him an ultimatum, either she gets a regular seat at the table or she locks him in every Saturday night. He squawked and so did his buddies but after a while they gave in and from the first night she sat down, she never lost.  She could read those cocky bastards like they were playing open hands.  And he bluffs?  He had sixteen levels of bullshit.  Her eyes, the tone of her voice, her bets, her jokes, the way she sipped her coffee, she was a master.  She won more money on shit hands than anyone in the history of the game. Every Saturday night, my father would lose two, three hundred bucks and she'd win it all back and then some. And I'd stand there, glued to her shoulder, from the time I was five years old, watching every hand, every move, studying how she did it.  That's why I'm such a good officer, I can look at a man's face and tell you exactly what he's holding, and if it's a shit hand, I know just what cards to deal him.\nPerson2: And what about your own hand?\nPerson1: No problem.  A pair of deuces?  Less? So what?  I bluff.  It used to tear me apart when I'd get one of my men killed, but what was I supposed to do?  Break down in front of the ones who were standing there waiting for me to tell them what to do?  Of course not, so I bluffed, and after a while, I started to fall for my own bluff. It was great, it made everything so much easier.  Sarge Is that why your hand's been shaking?\nPerson1: It could be worse.  You know the first thing they teach you at O.C.S.? Lie to your men.\nPerson2: Oh, yeah?\nPerson1: Not in so many words, but they tell you you can have all the firepower in the world and if your men don't have good morale, it's not worth a damn.  So if you're scared or empty or half-a-step from a Section Eight, do you tell your men?  Of course not.  You bluff, you lie.\nPerson2: And how do you bluff yourself?\nPerson1: Simple, numbers.  Every time you kill one of your men, you tell yourself you just saved the lives of two, three, ten, a hundred others. We lost, what, thirty-one on the cliffs?  I'll bet we saved ten times that number by putting out those guns.  That's over three hundred men.  Maybe five hundred.  A thousand. Then thousand.  Any number you want. See?  It's simple.  It lets you always choose mission over men.\nPerson2: Except this time, the mission IS a man.\nPerson1: That's the rub.  I liked Wade.  Who's Ryan?  If they're both standing in front of me and I have to shoot one or the other, how do I choose?

Besides, when you hear from up here that there's a full house and that people are laughing, having fun... Then you're happy too.  So I've been wasting my breath? You pretend to agree with me, but as soon as my back is turned, you do what you want!  Get out of here! I don't want to lay eyes on you again! This is the last straw! Your mother's right, you're crazy!!  But how'd he do it? The little bastard! By watching, he's learned! It's incredible!  I'm letting the box office know you're not to set foot even into the theatre!

Death?  Don't talk about death to me.  I have been living with death for the last six months.  Why do you think I'm in the hospital?  I take a handful of pills to get away from you.

I know you didn't ask me.  You didn't ask me but I did it.\nPerson2: Well...\nPerson1: I did it on my own.  I did this all on my own.  I ain't laying it on anybody.  Nothing on anybody.  I'll tell you something, though, it's about time that I squared away my accounts... you know.  I am squaring away my accounts with life.  Maye this whole thing is gonna end, somehow.  Maybe it'll just end! Maybe I'll just close my eyes and the whole thing will be over. That would be all right too!  I said... I thought I would square it away with you... you know?  That I would get you down here and that I would say so long to you... or, if you wanted... you know, to take a trip...\nPerson2: What trip?\nPerson1: I'm getting out of here, man.  I'm not going to stay here and I'm not giving up.  I mean, huh, they're going to kill me, anyway.  So forget it!  But, if I can get out of this... I am going to get out. And, how I'm going to do it is to get a jet out of here and I'm flying the fuck out... That's all, Leon.  If you want to come with me, then you're entitled... you can come.  You're free to do what you want.\nPerson2: I'm free to do what I want?  And you think I would want to go with you some place on a plane?  Where?

Could the boy perhaps come in useful when and if the day ever comes for you to face up to the man you married?\nPerson2: Have you finished?\nPerson1: When did you learn about his taste for kids, huh? On your honeymoon? Or was it later, when bitterness set in and you turned against your beloved but weak little brother? How did you find out? Did he confess? Try to convert you perhaps? Or was it womans intuition? Or just the way he treated you?",

I wouldn't be alive today if I weren't one of the biggest fans truth ever had.\nPerson2: Well--part of it is that heroes basically hate home and never stay there very long, and make awful messes while they're there.\nPerson1: Go on.\nPerson2: And they have very mixed feelings about women.  They hate them in a way.  One reason they like war so much is that they can capture enemy women and not have to make love to them slowly and gently.  They can scrog them, as you say--  for revenge.\nPerson1: You learned this in some college course?\nPerson2: I learned a lot of things in college.

I want you, and I want to get us out of this shithole.  There's only one way to do that.\nPerson1: Are you sure?  About me, I mean?\nPerson2: I came back for you; this morning I came back.  Before I even knew about the money. You're what I want.\nPerson2: The only reason I stormed off is because you sort of spooked me talking about Jake.  But I've had nothing but time to think about it. It keeps coming back to you and me and us getting the hell out of here. But we've got to get the money, baby.  We get the money, I get the car, then we get the hell out.\nPerson1: You said you couldn't kill anybody.\nPerson2: We don't have to kill him.  Just knock him out and tie him up 'till we get away.",
